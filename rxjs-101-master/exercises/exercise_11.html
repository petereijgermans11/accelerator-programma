You can find this exercise at Stackblitz, as it is an Angular exercise:

Fork from here:

The task to complete: This example shows a basic application that uses
a BehaviorSubject to maintain some local state between server calls. 

This BehaviorSubject is not necessary, so the application needs to be updated
and refactored to not contain any Subjects. 

This will incidentally also give you the opportunity to simplify the application.
